Utility classes for One Logger.

Create or install unmanaged/unpackaged utility classes for One Logger.
You can either create this class directly or install our unmanaged package.
These classes allow One Logger to:

-   Debug to the system console (Apex Log).
-   Retrieve the stack trace string.
-   Obtain limits for your default namespace.

## Installation

Install or create these components after you install the One Logger managed package.

To install the unmanaged package, use the following link:

```
https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t5e000000vn4t
```

Alternatively, deploy all code in the `src/` directory from the GitHub [one-logger-utils](https://github.com/kratapps/one-logger-utils) repository.
